* Make Zenmap unit tests work. Guessing lots don't, since r32569 fixed real code
  that matched some unit tests, too.

* Make sure Ndiff, Zenmap are 2to3 compatible with python -3

* Script to check for updated versions of included libs. Have shell for libpcap,
  but should convert to python.

* NSE stuff
  * broadcast-srvloc-info - test
  * broadcast-rpcbind - write, test
  * deflate/gzip for HTTP, etc.
  * Consolidate utility functions

* Grock libdnet, consider separate release?

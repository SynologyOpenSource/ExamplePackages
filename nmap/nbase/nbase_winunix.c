/*
This code makes it possible to check for input on stdin on Windows without
blocking. There are two obstacles that need to be overcome. The first is that
select on Windows works for sockets only, not stdin. The other is that the
Windows command shell doesn't echo typed characters to the screen unless the
program is actively reading from stdin (which would normally mean blocking).

The strategy is to create a background thread that constantly reads from stdin.
The thread blocks while reading, which lets characters be echoed. The thread
writes each block of data into an anonymous pipe. We juggle file descriptors and
Windows file handles to make the rest of the program think that the other end of
the pipe is stdin. Only the thread keeps a reference to the real stdin. Windows
has a PeekNamedPipe function that we use to check for input in the pipe without
blocking.

Call win_stdin_start_thread to start the thread and win_stdin_ready for the
non-blocking input check. Any other operations on stdin (read, scanf, etc.)
should be transparent, except I noticed that eof(0) returns 1 when there is
nothing in the pipe, but will return 0 again if more is written to the pipe. Any
data buffered but not delivered to the program before starting the background
thread may be lost when the thread is started.

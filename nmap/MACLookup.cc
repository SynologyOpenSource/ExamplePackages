 * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software             *
 * (https://npcap.org) for packet capture and transmission. It is under    *

 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *

 * Source License Contributor Agreement. This is important because we      *
 * fund the project by selling licenses with various terms, and also       *
 * because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating          *
 * problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).       *

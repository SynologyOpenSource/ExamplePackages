 * The Nmap license generally prohibits companies from using and           *
 * redistributing Nmap in commercial products, but we sell a special Nmap  *
 * OEM Edition with a more permissive license and special features for     *
 * this purpose. See https://nmap.org/oem                                  *

 * If you have received a written Nmap license agreement or contract       *
 * stating terms other than these (such as an Nmap OEM license), you may   *
 * choose to use and redistribute Nmap under those terms instead.          *
 *                                                                         *
 * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software             *
 * (https://npcap.org) for packet capture and transmission. It is under    *
 * separate license terms which forbid redistribution without special      *
 * permission. So the official Nmap Windows builds may not be              *
 * redistributed without special permission (such as an Nmap OEM           *

 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *

 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *
 * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to submit your         *
 * changes as a Github PR or by email to the dev@nmap.org mailing list     *

 * specify otherwise, it is understood that you are offering us very       *
 * broad rights to use your submissions as described in the Nmap Public    *
 * Source License Contributor Agreement. This is important because we      *
 * fund the project by selling licenses with various terms, and also       *
 * because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating          *
 * problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).       *
 *                                                                         *
